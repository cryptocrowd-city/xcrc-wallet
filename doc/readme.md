However, it downloads and stores the entire history of XCRC transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.♪◙♪◙Running♪◙---------------------♪◙The following are some helpful notes on how to run xcrc on your native platform.♪◙♪◙### Unix♪◙♪◙Unpack the files into a directory and run:♪◙♪◙- ./cryptocrowd-qt (GUI) or ./cryptocrowdd (headless)♪◙♪◙### Windows♪◙♪◙Unpack the files into a directory, and then run cryptocrowd-qt.exe.♪◙♪◙### OSX♪◙♪◙Drag CRyptoCrowd-Qt to your applications folder, and then run CRyptoCrowd-Qt.♪◙♪◙### Need Help?♪◙♪◙* Ask for help on [Discord](https://discord.me/cryptocrowdcrypto) or on the [CRyptoCrowd Telegram](https://t.me/cryptocrowdcrypto).♪◙* Join our [Reddit Community](https://www.reddit.com/r/CRyptoCrowdCoin/)♪◙* Tweet at [CRyptoCrowd-Crypto](https://twitter.com/CRyptoCrowdCoin)♪◙♪◙### Ran into a Bug?♪◙♪◙* Submit an Issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/cryptocrowd-crypto/CRyptoCrowd/issues)♪◙♪◙Building♪◙---------------------♪◙The following are developer notes on how to build xcrc on your native platform.
