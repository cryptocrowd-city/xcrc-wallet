Setup
---------------------
[CRyptoCrowd Core](http://cryptocrowd.city.org/#downloads) is the original CRyptoCrowd client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of BWK transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run bwk on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- ./bulwark-qt (GUI) or ./bulwarkd (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run bulwark-qt.exe.

### OSX

Drag Bulwark-Qt to your applications folder, and then run Bulwark-Qt.
